        <h1>Steven Sousa</h1>
        <b>Hi All!</b>
        <p>I am a junior Computer Science student at Bridgewater State Univeristy. Here's a quick summary of my life:
            I was born in Falmouth, MA in 1998 and moved to Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil at the age of 9. After graduating High School in December of 2016, 
            I spent the first 6 months of 2017 in the US and then moved back to Brazil to start a CS major at Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Minas Gerais (PUC MG), 
            but dropped out after my first semester there. I moved back to the US in March of 2018 and have been living here since. I started my higher education journey in the Fall of 2020 at Cape Cod Community College
            and started at Bridgewater State University in the Fall of 2023 after taking a semester off. Currently I reside in Plymouth MA with my wife and soon to be born daughter. 
            Here are some courses that I have taken and currently taking.
